# PackBuddy
Build Smart and Personalised Travel Packing Lists


### App Description
- PackBuddy is a Mobile App that builds smart and customized travel packing lists for your trip.

- As the user starts the app, they are given 2 options they can either generate a packing list for a new trip or they can navigate to the list of their previous trips and continue using the previously generated packing list.

- Once the user clicks on the New Trip, they are asked to fill in some details regarding their trip like to which place they are traveling, when are they traveling, whether they are traveling by train/flight/Bus/Car and where will they be staying in a Homestay or a Hotel.

- After this, the user is navigated to an Activities page which comprises a list of activities like Swimming, Hiking, Business, etc. from which the user can select the activities they will be doing during the trip. Apart from this, there is also an additional option to add a custom activity that might not be present in the list.

- Once all of this information is provided to the app, the app first generates the weather forecast of that place and then generates a personalized list of packing items for the user.

- The packing list is completely interactive and every packing item comprises a tag showing the activity name for this that item has been generated and the user can mark the items as completed once they are packed.

- There is also an option to add custom packing items that might not be present in the generated list, the user can thus add custom packing items that will also become part of the total packing list.

- Further, the user can also navigate the previous trips tab where they can see a list of the trips they created packing lists for, and they can individually navigate to every trip and edit the previously generated packing list.
